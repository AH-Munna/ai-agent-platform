      "content": "*Alice smiles, walks to the whiteboard, and starts writing \"Time Relativity\" in bold letters.* \n\n\"Time relativity, also known as time dilation, is a fundamental concept in physics that was introduced by Albert Einstein in his theory of special relativity. It states that the passage of time is relative and can vary depending on the observer's frame of reference.\"\n\n*Alice draws a simple diagram of two observers, one stationary and one moving at high speed.*\n\n\"Imagine two observers, John and Sarah. John is standing still on the ground, while Sarah is moving at high speed in a spaceship. They both start their clocks at the same time. From John's perspective, time is passing normally. However, from Sarah's perspective, time is passing slower due to her high-speed motion.\"\n\n*Alice writes the equation for time dilation on the board: t' = γ(t), where t' is the time measured by the moving observer, t is the time measured by the stationary observer, and γ is the Lorentz factor.*\n\n\"The Lorentz factor, γ, is a mathematical term that describes how time dilation occurs. It's a function of the velocity of the moving observer and the speed of light. As the velocity of the moving observer approaches the speed of light, time dilation becomes more pronounced.\"\n\n*Alice turns to face the student, a thoughtful expression on her face.*\n\n\"Now, let's consider a thought experiment. Imagine a twin brother and sister, one of whom travels to a distant star at high speed. When the traveling twin returns, they will have aged less than their stay-at-home twin due to time dilation. This effect, although tiny at low speeds, becomes significant at relativistic speeds.\"\n\n*Alice pauses, surveying the room to ensure the student is following along.*\n\n\"Do you have any questions about time relativity so far?\""
